#Firebase Game

This game is a two player multiplayer game. It is meant to simulate a kind of sword-fighting and magic spell using experience. You can think of it as a complex game of Rock Paper Scissors. However, instead of each player sending out one move at the same time where the better of the two wins, players sequentially take turns attacking and defending. The player attacking will send out a barrage of 5 attacks at a time and the defending player will have to parry each attack, one at a time and will have exactly one second to react to each attack.  Attacking players have 8 different options for attacks to send out. While defending players also have 8 options to defend with, only one of those options will parry the displayed attack. Attacks comprise of 4 sword slashes (using the arrow keys) and 4 magic spells (using keys Q,W,E and R).

Left Key is a top left to bottom right sword swipe ( \ )

Right Key is a top right to bottom left sword swipe ( / )

Up Key is a vertical sword slash ( | )

Down Key is a horizontal sword slash ( - )

Q Key is a magical frost blast ( * )

W Key is a magical thunder strike ( ~ )

E Key is a magical fire blast ( X )

R Key is a magical earth crack ( ^ )

Parry methods differ for sword attacks and magical attacks. To parry sword attacks, you simply need to input the opposite attack that you see on the screen. So if you see an incoming vertical slash attack ( | ) you would need to input the Down Key to block with a horizontal slash ( - ) and vice versa. If you see an incoming top right to bottom left sword swipe attack ( / ) you would need to input the Right Key to block with a top left to bottom right sword swipe ( \ ) and vice versa.

Parrying magical attacks is like playing RPS with 4 elements instead of 3.  So instead of rock beats scissors beats paper beats rock, it goes: Thunder ( ~ ) parries earth ( ^ ) parries fire ( X ) parries ice ( * ) parries thunder ( ~ ).  Player 1 attacks first, and the first player to land 20 attacks wins, good luck!
